### Hello, nerds ðŸ‘‹

<!--![Meow! ](https://github.githubassets.com/images/mona-whisper.gif "Meow! ")-->

I store my projects here (and on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/sqyqh)). Most of them are privates or only shared with my students (sources, courses, slides, exercises...), and some are publics.

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sqyqh), you can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sqyqh) and read me on [DEV.to](https://dev.to/sqyqh).

Let's code freedom!
